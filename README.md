# IoT Project
The project implements an innovative system that support and manage the intake of a medications for patients affected by pathological illness such as dementia, amnesia and dyschronometria (distorted time perception). The monitoring is done remotely by people close to the patient such as family members or medical personnel.
  The software was fully developed using the Python programming language, and tested on a ESP32 DevKitC Flash Memory attached to PIR sensor that detect the needer's hand movements and an audible and visible alarm system that is activated when the medical pill intake is needed. The communication between the software and the device are implemented through the MQTT protocol and  I2C protocol.
